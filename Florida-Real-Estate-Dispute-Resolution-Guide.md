## 1. Earnest Money/Deposit Disputes

### Overview

Earnest money (also called "escrow deposit" or "binder deposit") is the good-faith deposit a buyer makes to demonstrate serious intent to purchase. When a transaction fails to close, disputes over who gets to keep this money are among the most common in Florida real estate.

### Common Scenarios

#### Buyer Backs Out
- **Within contingency period**: If the buyer cancels during an inspection, financing, or appraisal contingency period and follows proper procedures, they are typically entitled to a refund.
- **After contingency expiration**: The seller may be entitled to retain the deposit as liquidated damages if the contract so provides.
- **Failure to obtain financing in good faith**: If the buyer made a good-faith effort but failed to secure financing per the contract terms, they may receive a refund under Florida Statutes.

#### Seller Backs Out
- **Seller refuses to close**: Buyer may be entitled to return of deposit PLUS potentially specific performance or actual damages.
- **Seller cannot deliver clear title**: Buyer typically entitled to full refund.
- **Seller accepts a higher offer**: Buyer entitled to deposit refund and may pursue damages.

#### Mutual Disagreement
- Both parties claim the deposit
- Parties dispute whether contingencies were properly satisfied
- Dispute over whether proper notice was given

### FAR/BAR Dispute Resolution Procedures

The standard Florida Realtors/Florida Bar (FAR/BAR) residential contract contains specific dispute resolution requirements:

#### Step 1: 10-Day Resolution Period
When there is a deposit dispute, the buyer and seller have **10 days after the date of conflicting demands** to resolve the dispute among themselves.

#### Step 2: Mandatory Mediation
If the dispute is not resolved within 10 days, the parties **must mediate** pursuant to the Florida Rules for Certified and Court-Appointed Mediators with a mediator who is:
- Certified by the Florida Supreme Court, OR
- Has real estate industry experience

**Cost Allocation:**
- Mediator's fee: Split equally between parties
- Each party pays their own attorney's fees during mediation

#### Step 3: Litigation
If mediation fails, the dispute proceeds to litigation. The prevailing party is entitled to attorney's fees.

> **CRITICAL - 2025 Case Law Update: Pesantes v. Kelley**
>
> In February 2025, the Florida Third District Court of Appeals ruled that **failure to complete pre-suit mediation bars recovery of attorney's fees, even if you win the lawsuit**. The court held that a party who skips mediation "has avoided paying attorney's fees to [the prevailing party]...This result, though, is dictated by the narrow language of paragraph 17's attorney's fees provision."
>
> **Practical Impact:** ALWAYS complete pre-suit mediation, even if you believe the other party will not participate. Document your mediation attempt thoroughly.

### Florida Statute 475.25 Requirements for Brokers

When there are conflicting demands on escrowed funds, Florida Statute 475.25 requires brokers to:

1. **Notify FREC within 15 business days** of receiving conflicting demands
2. **Implement one of four "escape procedures" within 30 business days:**
   - Request an Escrow Disbursement Order (EDO) from FREC
   - Submit to arbitration (with consent of all parties)
   - File an interpleader action in court
   - Submit to mediation (with written consent of all parties; must complete within 90 days)

**Key Broker Rules:**
- Brokers must immediately deposit funds in escrow upon receipt
- Brokers may maintain up to $1,000 of personal/brokerage funds in sales escrow accounts
- Brokers may maintain up to $5,000 in property management escrow accounts
- Monthly reconciliation of escrow accounts is required

### Escrow Disbursement Order (EDO) Process Through FREC

An EDO is a formal determination by the Florida Real Estate Commission directing how disputed escrow funds should be distributed.

#### Who Can Request an EDO
- Only brokers holding funds in their own escrow accounts
- Must act within 30 business days of the dispute

#### EDO Limitations
| Dispute Amount | EDO Available? |
|----------------|----------------|
| Up to $50,000 | Yes |
| Over $50,000 | No - must interplead or use other methods |

#### EDO Process Timeline

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Conflicting demands received | Day 0 |
| 2 | Notify FREC | Within 15 business days |
| 3 | File EDO request | Within 30 business days |
| 4 | FREC reviews and schedules | 60-120 days typical |
| 5 | Hearing before FREC | Varies |
| 6 | Final Order issued | After hearing |
| 7 | Disburse funds | Promptly upon Final Order |

#### If EDO Request is Withdrawn
If you request an EDO but the dispute settles or goes to court before the order is issued, you must notify FREC in writing within **10 business days**.

### Interpleader Actions

An interpleader is a court action where the escrow agent asks the court to determine who is entitled to the disputed funds.

#### When to Use Interpleader
- Disputes over $50,000 (FREC cannot issue EDO)
- Title company or attorney holds escrow (not broker)
- Complex disputes with multiple claimants
- When parties refuse to cooperate with other resolution methods

#### Interpleader Process

1. **Escrow agent hires attorney** to draft Complaint for Interpleader
2. **Complaint filed** with clerk of court in county where property is located
3. **Buyer and seller served** with lawsuit
4. **Escrow funds deposited** into court registry
5. **Escrow agent dismissed** from case (typically)
6. **Buyer and seller litigate** over funds
7. **Court issues judgment** determining rightful owner

#### Costs and Fees
- Escrow agent's attorney's fees deducted from deposit before it goes to court registry
- Each party pays their own litigation costs
- Prevailing party may recover attorney's fees if contract provides

> **Cost Warning:** Interpleader litigation costs can exceed the disputed deposit amount. A $10,000 deposit dispute can easily generate $15,000+ in combined legal fees, making it a "lose-lose" situation driven by principle rather than financial sense.

### Timeline and Cost Summary

| Resolution Method | Typical Timeline | Estimated Costs |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Negotiated settlement | 1-4 weeks | $0-500 (if attorneys involved) |
| FREC EDO | 3-6 months | $200-500 filing; no attorney required |
| Mediation | 1-3 months | $500-2,000 mediator fee (split) |
| Arbitration | 2-4 months | $2,000-5,000+ |
| Interpleader | 6-18 months | $5,000-20,000+ per party |

## 2. Contract Breach Claims

### Buyer Breach Scenarios and Remedies

#### Common Buyer Breaches
- Failure to close after all contingencies satisfied
- Failure to make good-faith effort to obtain financing
- Providing false information on mortgage application
- Failure to deposit required funds
- Refusing to sign closing documents

#### Seller's Remedies for Buyer Breach

**Option 1: Retain Deposit as Liquidated Damages**
- Most common remedy under standard FAR/BAR contract
- Seller keeps earnest money deposit
- Both parties released from further obligations
- Must be explicitly elected by seller

**Option 2: Sue for Actual Damages**
- Seller may recover provable financial losses
- May include: carrying costs, re-listing costs, difference in subsequent sale price
- More time-consuming and expensive than liquidated damages
- Generally cannot choose BOTH liquidated damages AND actual damages

**Option 3: Specific Performance**
- Force buyer to complete purchase
- Rarely practical (buyer may lack funds)
- Court may order buyer to pay purchase price within specified days
- If buyer fails, property sold at judicial sale

### Seller Breach Scenarios and Remedies

#### Common Seller Breaches
- Refusal to close
- Inability to deliver marketable title
- Failure to make required repairs
- Accepting higher competing offer
- Material misrepresentation about property

#### Buyer's Remedies for Seller Breach

**Option 1: Return of Deposit + Termination**
- Buyer receives full deposit refund
- Contract terminated
- No further obligations

**Option 2: Actual Damages**
- Buyer may recover provable financial losses
- May include: inspection costs, appraisal fees, increased costs of replacement property, temporary housing
- Must prove damages with reasonable certainty

**Option 3: Specific Performance**
- Force seller to convey property
- Preferred remedy for real estate (each parcel is unique)
- More commonly granted to buyers than sellers
- May include abatement of purchase price for defects

### Specific Performance in Florida

Specific performance is an equitable remedy that compels a party to fulfill its contractual obligations. In real estate, this means forcing the sale/purchase to occur as agreed.

#### Requirements for Specific Performance

To obtain specific performance in Florida, you must prove:

1. **Valid and enforceable contract** - Clear offer, acceptance, consideration, and meeting of minds
2. **Clear and definite terms** - Specific and unambiguous contract terms
3. **Inadequate legal remedy** - Money damages would not adequately compensate
4. **Ready, willing, and able** - Plaintiff must be able to perform their obligations
5. **Justice requires it** - Court has discretion based on fairness

#### Availability to Buyers vs. Sellers

| Party | Availability | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Buyer | Generally available | Real property is unique; money damages rarely adequate |
| Seller | Available but limited | Court orders buyer to pay; if buyer fails, judicial sale held |

#### Key Limitations

- **Statute of limitations**: 1 year for specific performance actions
- **Must be "ready, willing, and able"**: If buyer cannot prove sufficient funds, claim fails
- **Lis pendens impact**: Filing suit for specific performance ties up property for years, even if ultimately unsuccessful
- **Court discretion**: Even if all elements met, court may decline if result would be unjust

### Liquidated Damages Enforcement

Liquidated damages clauses specify in advance the amount of damages payable upon breach, rather than requiring proof of actual damages.

#### Florida Requirements for Enforceability

Under Florida law (Lefemine v. Baron), a liquidated damages clause is enforceable ONLY if:

1. **Damages were difficult to ascertain** at the time the contract was made
2. **Amount specified is reasonable** - A reasonable estimate of probable loss
3. **Not a penalty** - Cannot be designed to punish the breaching party

#### Reasonableness Standards

| Deposit Amount | Presumption |
|----------------|-------------|
| 10% or less of purchase price | Generally reasonable |
| Over 10% of purchase price | May face heightened scrutiny |
| Grossly disproportionate to harm | Likely unenforceable as penalty |

#### The Lefemine v. Baron Rule

> **CRITICAL:** If a contract gives the seller the option between liquidated damages AND suing for actual damages, the liquidated damages clause may be unenforceable. Florida courts hold this "indicates an intent to penalize the defaulting buyer and negates the intent to liquidate damages."

#### Common Defenses to Liquidated Damages

1. **Contribution to default**: Non-breaching party contributed to the breach
2. **Damages were ascertainable**: Actual damages could have been calculated at contract formation
3. **Unconscionable amount**: Damages "shock the conscience" of the court
4. **Procedural issues**: Improper notice or failure to elect remedy properly

### Actual Damages Calculation

When liquidated damages are unavailable or insufficient, actual damages must be proven.

#### Seller's Actual Damages (Buyer Breach)

| Damage Type | Description | Documentation Needed |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Difference in sale price | Original price minus eventual resale price | Both contracts, closing statements |
| Carrying costs | Mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities during delay | Bills, statements |
| Re-listing costs | Realtor commissions, marketing expenses | Invoices, listing agreements |
| Lost opportunity | Provable losses from missed opportunities | Depends on specifics |

#### Buyer's Actual Damages (Seller Breach)

| Damage Type | Description | Documentation Needed |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Out-of-pocket costs | Inspection, appraisal, survey fees | Receipts, invoices |
| Temporary housing | Costs of alternative housing during delay | Lease, receipts |
| Increased purchase costs | Higher price of replacement property | Contracts, closing statements |
| Moving/storage | Extra moving or storage costs | Invoices |
| Lost deposits | Non-refundable costs from failed transaction | Receipts |

## 3. Disclosure Disputes

### Johnson v. Davis Claims

The landmark Florida Supreme Court case *Johnson v. Davis*, 480 So. 2d 625 (Fla. 1985), established that sellers have a duty to affirmatively disclose known hidden defects in residential real estate transactions.

#### Background

Prior to 1985, Florida followed "caveat emptor" (buyer beware) for real estate. *Johnson v. Davis* changed this by creating an affirmative duty to disclose.

### Proving the Four Elements

To prevail on a Johnson v. Davis nondisclosure claim, the buyer must prove ALL of the following:

#### Element 1: Seller's Actual Knowledge
- Seller KNEW about the defect
- Constructive knowledge (should have known) may be sufficient in some cases
- Evidence may include: prior repair attempts, complaints, inspections, insurance claims

#### Element 2: Material Effect on Value
- Defect must materially affect the property's value
- Not just cosmetic or minor issues
- Would a reasonable buyer consider this important in deciding whether to purchase?

#### Element 3: Not Readily Observable
- Defect was not readily observable by buyer
- Was unknown to buyer at time of purchase
- Buyer has no duty to inspect; must only observe what is "obvious"

#### Element 4: Failure to Disclose
- Seller failed to disclose the defect to buyer
- Active concealment strengthens claim
- Partial disclosure may be insufficient

> **Important Distinction:** Unlike fraud claims, Johnson v. Davis claims do NOT require proof that the nondisclosure was fraudulent or negligent. Per *Billian v. Mobil Corporation*, 710 So. 2d 984 (4th DCA 1998), buyers need only prove the four elements above.

### "As Is" Clauses and Disclosure Duties

**Florida courts have consistently held that "As-Is" clauses do NOT bar claims for fraudulent nondisclosure or misrepresentation in residential real estate transactions.**

The duty to disclose applies regardless of whether the property is sold "as is" if:
- Property is residential
- Seller had actual knowledge of a material defect
- Defect was not readily observable

### Statute of Limitations

| Claim Type | Limitations Period | Begins Running |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Fraud | 4 years | When fraud discovered or should have been discovered |
| Negligent misrepresentation | 4 years | From closing or discovery |
| Breach of contract | 5 years | From closing |

### Damages Available

Successful Johnson v. Davis claimants may recover:

1. **Cost of repair** - Reasonable cost to remedy the defect
2. **Diminution in value** - Difference between value as represented and actual value
3. **Consequential damages** - Related losses (temporary housing, storage, etc.)
4. **Rescission** - In egregious cases, unwinding the entire transaction

### Defense Strategies

Sellers facing disclosure claims may assert:

1. **No actual knowledge**: Seller was unaware of the defect
2. **Defect was observable**: Buyer should have seen the issue
3. **Disclosure was made**: Seller did disclose, buyer ignored or waived
4. **Not material**: Defect does not materially affect value
5. **Buyer's inspection**: Buyer's own inspection revealed the issue
6. **Statute of limitations**: Claim filed too late

---

## 4. Title Disputes

### Quiet Title Actions

A quiet title action is a lawsuit filed under Chapter 65 of the Florida Statutes to establish ownership of real property and eliminate competing claims or "clouds" on the title.

#### Elements Required to State a Claim

To bring a quiet title action, you must allege:

1. **You have title** to the subject property
2. **A cloud on title exists** - Some competing claim or defect
3. **The cloud is invalid** - The competing claim should be removed

#### Standing to File

You must have a legitimate legal or equitable interest in the property. The Fourth District Court has ruled that "a party must have title to a property to bring an action to quiet title. With no title, there is nothing to be quieted."

#### Seven-Year Rule

Florida Statute 65.061(3) requires that the plaintiff's claim to title be good for **at least 7 years** prior to filing, unless a court orders otherwise. The claim must be from an identifiable source such as:
- Deed
- Adverse possession
- Through the defendants

#### Quiet Title Procedure

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Determine eligibility | Must have valid claim to title, not just possession |
| 2 | Gather documentation | Deeds, tax records, title search, surveys |
| 3 | File complaint | Circuit court in county where property is located |
| 4 | Serve notice | All known and unknown potential claimants |
| 5 | Publication (if needed) | 4 consecutive weeks in local newspaper |
| 6 | Court proceedings | If defendants respond, case proceeds to hearing |
| 7 | Final judgment | Court determines rightful owner |

#### Timeline and Costs

| Factor | Range |
|--------|-------|
| Simple cases | 30 days - 6 months |
| Complex disputes | 1-2+ years |
| Attorney fees | $1,500 - $5,000+ |
| Title search | ~$125 |
| Publication | ~$150 |
| Guardian Ad Litem (if needed) | $300-600 |
| Filing fees | $300-400 |

### Title Insurance Claims

Title insurance protects property owners and lenders from losses arising from defects in title that existed before the policy was issued.

#### What Title Insurance Covers (Typically)

- Liens recorded against property
- Errors in public records
- Forgery or fraud in prior documents
- Unknown heirs claiming ownership
- Incorrect legal descriptions
- Undisclosed easements
- Encroachments discovered post-closing

#### What Title Insurance Does NOT Cover (Typically)

- Defects known to insured but not disclosed
- Post-policy title defects
- Zoning violations
- Environmental contamination
- Government actions (condemnation, etc.)
- Matters that would be revealed by survey (unless survey coverage purchased)

#### Filing a Title Insurance Claim

1. **Review your policy** - Confirm the issue is covered
2. **Notify insurer in writing** - As soon as issue discovered
3. **Provide documentation** - Deed, policy, description of problem
4. **Insurer investigates** - May take 30-90 days
5. **Resolution** - Insurer may: pay claim, defend against claim, cure defect, or deny coverage

#### Disputes with Title Insurers

If your claim is denied:
- Request written explanation of denial
- Review policy exclusions carefully
- Consider attorney review
- File complaint with Florida Office of Insurance Regulation if appropriate
- Litigation may be necessary for significant claims

### Boundary Disputes

Boundary disputes occur when neighboring property owners disagree over the location of the dividing line between their properties.

#### Common Causes

- Inaccurate or outdated surveys
- Ambiguous legal descriptions
- Fence lines that don't match property lines
- Encroaching structures
- Adverse possession claims

#### Resolution Options

1. **Negotiation** - Often the fastest and cheapest solution
2. **Survey** - Hire a licensed surveyor to determine actual boundary
3. **Mediation** - Neutral third party assists with resolution
4. **Boundary line agreement** - Written agreement between neighbors
5. **Litigation** - Quiet title action or declaratory judgment

#### Court Outcomes

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ejectment | Court orders removal of encroaching structure/possession |
| Declaratory judgment | Court legally determines the property boundary |
| Adverse possession recognition | Court grants title to party meeting statutory requirements |

### Easement Conflicts

Easements grant the right to use another's land for a specific purpose. Disputes often arise regarding scope, maintenance, or interference with easement rights.

#### Types of Easements in Florida

- **Express easement** - Created by written agreement
- **Implied easement** - Arising from circumstances (prior use, necessity)
- **Easement by necessity** - Access to landlocked property (Florida Statute 704.01)
- **Prescriptive easement** - Acquired through continuous adverse use (20+ years in Florida)

#### Common Easement Disputes

- Blocked access
- Overuse beyond scope of easement
- Maintenance responsibilities
- Termination or abandonment claims
- Interference with dominant or servient estate

#### Resolution Under Florida Law

Under Florida Statute 704.01(2), when a property owner objects to a statutory way of necessity, either party may file suit in circuit court to determine:
- Whether the easement exists
- The location and scope of the easement
- Compensation owed to servient estate owner

### Lien Priority Disputes

When multiple liens exist on a property, disputes may arise over which lien takes priority in case of foreclosure.

#### General Priority Rules in Florida

1. **First in time, first in right** - Generally, liens are prioritized by recording date
2. **Property tax liens** - Always superior to all other liens
3. **Purchase money mortgages** - May have special priority
4. **Mechanics liens** - Priority from date of first work, not recording
5. **HOA/Condo liens** - May have "super lien" status for assessments

#### Resolving Priority Disputes

- Title search to determine recording dates
- Review of lien documents for errors
- Quiet title action to determine priorities
- Settlement negotiations
- Foreclosure litigation

---

## 5. HOA/Condo Disputes

### Legal Framework

Florida community associations are governed by:
- **Chapter 718** - Florida Condominium Act (condos)
- **Chapter 719** - Florida Cooperative Act (co-ops)
- **Chapter 720** - Florida Homeowners' Association Act (HOAs)

### Assessment Disputes

#### Challenging Assessments

**For Condos (Chapter 718):**
- Assessment disputes are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration
- Must challenge through litigation
- Association's lien rights are powerful

**For HOAs (Chapter 720):**
- Pre-suit mediation required before litigation
- Cannot use arbitration for collection disputes

#### Owner Defenses to Assessments

1. Assessment not properly adopted
2. Improper notice of assessment
3. Assessment exceeds board authority
4. Assessment is discriminatory
5. Mathematical errors

> **Warning:** Even if you dispute an assessment, it continues to accrue interest and late fees. Consider paying under protest while disputing.

### Rule Enforcement Challenges

#### Disputable Matters (Subject to ADR)

- Reasonable rules applied unreasonably
- Selective enforcement claims
- Rules inconsistent with governing documents
- Architectural control decisions

#### Fining Procedures

Florida law requires associations to follow specific procedures before imposing fines:

1. Written notice of violation
2. Opportunity to be heard before fining committee
3. Fining committee must be at least 3 members not on board
4. Fine cannot exceed $100/day or $1,000 maximum per violation (unless continuing)

### Election Disputes

Election and recall disputes have special procedures and **cannot be resolved through mediation** - they must go through DBPR arbitration or court.

#### DBPR Arbitration for Elections

| Step | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| File petition with DBPR | Within 60 days of election |
| Association response | 20 days |
| Arbitrator decision | 30 days after submission |
| Appeal to court | 30 days after decision |

### Access/Common Area Disputes

#### Records Access

Owners have extensive rights to inspect association records. If denied:
1. Written demand for access
2. Association must respond within 10 business days
3. If denied, pre-suit mediation or arbitration
4. Statutory penalties for wrongful denial

#### Common Area Use

Disputes over common area use are subject to mandatory arbitration (condos) or pre-suit mediation (HOAs).

### Mandatory vs. Voluntary Arbitration

| Association Type | Requirement | Governing Law |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Condominium | Mandatory arbitration for defined "disputes" | Section 718.1255 |
| Cooperative | Mandatory arbitration | Section 719.1255 |
| HOA | Pre-suit mediation | Section 720.311 |

#### What Qualifies as a "Dispute" Under 718.1255

Disputes eligible for mandatory arbitration include:
- Authority of board to require owner action
- Authority to alter common elements
- Failure to properly conduct elections
- Failure to give proper notice
- Failure to properly conduct meetings
- Failure to allow records inspection

#### What is EXCLUDED from "Dispute" Definition

- Title to unit or common element
- Warranty interpretation/enforcement
- Assessment levy or collection
- Eviction/tenant removal
- Fiduciary duty breach claims
- Damage claims for maintenance failures

### 2024-2025 Updates

**HB 1203 (2024)** added significant requirements:
- HOAs with 100+ parcels must post core records online by January 1, 2025
- Enhanced transparency requirements
- Stricter fining procedures
- Increased accountability measures

---

## 6. Construction/Repair Disputes

### Chapter 558: Pre-Suit Notice Requirements

Florida Statute Chapter 558 requires specific steps before filing any construction defect lawsuit.

#### Mandatory Pre-Suit Notice

Before filing suit for any construction defect, you **MUST**:

| Claimant Type | Notice Period |
|---------------|---------------|
| Individual property owner | 60 days before filing |
| HOA with 20+ parcels | 120 days before filing |

#### Contents of Notice

The written notice must include:
- Description of the defect
- Location of the defect
- Nature of the problem
- Photographs if available

#### Consequences of Skipping Notice

If you file a construction defect lawsuit without complying with Chapter 558:

- You may forfeit certain rights

### Warranty Claims

#### Types of Construction Warranties

1. **Express warranties** - Explicitly stated by builder
2. **Implied warranty of habitability** - Property suitable for intended use
3. **Implied warranty of fitness** - Work performed in workmanlike manner

#### Warranty Exhaustion Requirement

Under proposed amendments to Chapter 558, before sending a notice of claim, property owners must **first exhaust any applicable warranty claims**.

### Latent Defect Claims

Latent defects are hidden problems not discoverable through reasonable inspection.

#### Statute of Limitations and Repose

| Limitation | Time Period | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Statute of limitations | 4 years | From discovery of defect |
| Statute of repose | 7 years | From certificate of occupancy (changed from 10 years in April 2023) |

> **Important 2023 Change:** Florida modified the statute of repose from 10 years to 7 years. All claims are now barred after 7 years, regardless of when the defect is discovered.

#### Tolling by Chapter 558 Notice

Per *Gindel v. Centex Homes*, 267 So. 3d 403 (Fla. 4th DCA 2019), serving a Chapter 558 notice within the repose period **tolls** the statute, preserving your claim.

### Contractor Liens (Chapter 713)

Florida's Construction Lien Law (Chapter 713) protects contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers who improve property but are not paid.

#### Who Can File a Lien

- Contractors (direct contract with owner)
- Subcontractors
- Sub-subcontractors and material suppliers
- Laborers
- Design professionals

#### Notice to Owner Requirement

All lienors (except laborers) must serve a "Notice to Owner" on the property owner:
- Before commencing work, OR
- Within 45 days after commencing work

#### Recording the Lien

| Requirement | Deadline |
|-------------|----------|
| Record claim of lien | Within 90 days after final furnishing |

#### Lien Contents

A valid claim of lien must include:
- Lienor's name and address
- Name of person lienor contracted with
- Description of labor/materials furnished
- Contract price or value
- Property description
- Amount unpaid

#### Enforcement

To enforce a construction lien, you must:
1. File lawsuit to foreclose lien
2. Sue within 1 year of recording lien
3. Prevailing party entitled to reasonable attorney's fees (Section 713.29)

#### Property Owner Protections

Florida law includes protections for property owners:
- Right to receive Notice to Owner
- Right to contractor's payment affidavit at closing
- May require lien releases before payment
- Final payment release cuts off lien rights

### Building Code Violations

If you discover your property has building code violations from prior work:

1. **Document the violations** - Get written reports from inspectors
2. **Preserve evidence** - Photographs, reports, communications
3. **Review warranties** - May still be enforceable
4. **Check permit history** - Unpermitted work may have different remedies
5. **Consider claims against** - Contractor, inspector, seller (if undisclosed)

---

## 7. Mediation in Florida

### FAR/BAR Mediation Requirements

The standard FAR/BAR residential contract requires mediation before litigation for most disputes.

#### When Mediation is Required

**Deposit Disputes:**
- 10-day period to resolve
- If unresolved, mandatory mediation
- Then litigation if mediation fails

**Other Disputes:**
- Mandatory mediation before litigation
- No 10-day waiting period
- Must use certified mediator or one with real estate experience

### Selecting a Mediator

#### Qualifications

A mediator for real estate disputes should be:
- Certified by the Florida Supreme Court, OR
- Have substantial real estate industry experience

#### Finding a Mediator

- Florida Dispute Resolution Center
- Local bar association panels
- Private mediation firms
- American Arbitration Association
- JAMS

#### Cost Considerations

| Fee Type | Typical Range |
|----------|---------------|
| Hourly rate | $200-500/hour |
| Half-day session | $750-1,500 |
| Full-day session | $1,500-3,000 |
| Administrative fees | $100-300 |

Cost is typically split equally between parties under FAR/BAR contract.

### Mediation Procedures

#### Before Mediation

1. Exchange relevant documents
2. Prepare mediation statement (optional but helpful)
3. Confirm decision-makers will attend
4. Review contract terms and desired outcomes

#### During Mediation

1. Opening statements by each party
2. Joint discussion of issues
3. Private caucuses with mediator
4. Negotiation of terms
5. Drafting of settlement agreement (if reached)

#### Mediation Tips

- Come prepared with documentation
- Know your BATNA (best alternative to negotiated agreement)
- Be realistic about likely outcomes
- Consider tax implications of settlement
- Ensure any settlement is in writing

### Settlement Agreement Enforcement

Mediated settlement agreements are enforceable contracts. To enforce:

1. File motion to enforce settlement agreement
2. Court treats agreement as any other contract
3. Prevailing party may recover attorney's fees if contract provides

### Pesantes v. Kelley Implications (2025)

This February 2025 Third DCA decision has major implications:

#### Key Holdings

1. **Pre-suit mediation is a condition precedent** to litigation under FAR/BAR contract
2. **Skipping mediation bars attorney fee recovery** - even for the prevailing party
3. **This applies even if the other party wouldn't participate**

#### Practical Guidance Post-Pesantes

1. **Always demand mediation in writing** before filing suit
2. **Document your mediation attempt** - keep copies of all correspondence
3. **Complete mediation** even if other party won't participate in good faith
4. **Obtain mediator's certification** that mediation was attempted
5. **Never file suit without completing mediation** - you forfeit attorney fees

## 8. Arbitration

### When Arbitration Applies

#### Contractual Arbitration

Many real estate contracts include arbitration clauses requiring disputes to be arbitrated rather than litigated. Check your:
- Purchase contract
- Listing agreement
- HOA/Condo documents
- Construction contracts

#### Statutory Arbitration

Florida law mandates arbitration for certain disputes:
- Condominium disputes under Section 718.1255
- Cooperative disputes under Section 719.1255
- Election/recall disputes in community associations

### FAA vs. Florida Arbitration Code

| Framework | Applies When | Key Differences |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) | Interstate commerce involved | Strong federal policy favoring arbitration |
| Florida Arbitration Code (Ch. 682) | Purely intrastate matters | Similar provisions but state-specific |

Most real estate transactions involve interstate commerce (financing, materials from other states), so the FAA often applies.

### Binding vs. Non-Binding Arbitration

| Type | Effect of Decision | Appeal Rights |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Binding | Final and enforceable as judgment | Very limited (fraud, corruption, etc.) |
| Non-binding | Advisory only | Either party may reject and proceed to trial |

**DBPR Condo Arbitration:** Non-binding initially, but becomes binding if not appealed within 30 days.

### Arbitration Clause Enforceability

Florida courts generally enforce arbitration clauses, but they may be invalidated if:

1. **Procedural unconscionability** - Take-it-or-leave-it contract with unequal bargaining power
2. **Substantive unconscionability** - Terms are unreasonably one-sided
3. **Not within scope** - Dispute falls outside arbitration clause language
4. **Waiver** - Party waived right to arbitrate by participating in litigation

### Arbitration Process

#### Pre-Arbitration

1. Demand for arbitration served
2. Arbitrator selected (per contract or by agreement)
3. Initial conference scheduled
4. Discovery conducted (often more limited than litigation)

#### Arbitration Hearing

1. Opening statements
2. Presentation of evidence
3. Witness testimony
4. Closing arguments
5. Post-hearing briefs (sometimes)

#### Award

1. Arbitrator issues written award
2. May or may not include reasoning
3. Award confirmed by court and entered as judgment

### Costs of Arbitration

| Cost Component | Typical Range |
|----------------|---------------|
| Filing fee | $500-2,000 |
| Arbitrator fees | $300-800/hour |
| Administrative fees | $500-3,000 |
| Full arbitration | $10,000-50,000+ |

> **Note:** Arbitration is often not cheaper than litigation. It can be faster, but costs add up quickly with arbitrator hourly fees.

## 9. Litigation

### Florida Court System Overview

| Court | Jurisdiction | Real Estate Matters |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Small Claims | Up to $8,000 | Minor disputes, some deposit issues |
| County Court | Up to $50,000 | Most residential disputes |
| Circuit Court | Over $50,000 or equity claims | Large cases, quiet title, specific performance |
| District Court of Appeal | Appeals from trial courts | Appellate review |
| Florida Supreme Court | Discretionary/conflict jurisdiction | Rare in real estate |

### Venue Selection

For real estate disputes, venue is typically proper in:
- County where property is located
- County where defendant resides
- County specified in contract (if enforceable)

### Lis Pendens (Notice of Pending Litigation)

A lis pendens is a recorded notice that litigation affecting property is pending.

#### Purpose

- Puts world on notice of pending lawsuit
- Anyone acquiring interest takes subject to lawsuit outcome
- Effectively prevents sale or refinancing during litigation

#### Recording Requirements

Must include:
- Names of parties
- Case number and court
- Description of property
- Statement of relief sought

#### Two Types of Lis Pendens

| Type | Basis | Bond Required? |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Lis Pendens of Right | Recorded instrument (mortgage) or mechanics lien | No |
| "Garden Variety" | Unrecorded document (sales contract) | Usually yes; must show "fair nexus" |

#### Duration

- Expires after 1 year unless founded on recorded instrument or lien
- May be extended by court for good cause

#### Removing a Lis Pendens

Options to discharge a lis pendens:
1. Motion showing lawsuit doesn't affect ownership
2. Motion based on lack of fair nexus
3. Bond posting
4. Resolution of underlying lawsuit

### Discovery Procedures

#### 2025 Rule Changes

Major amendments to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure took effect January 1, 2025:

**Initial Disclosures (New Rule 1.280):**
- Parties must make initial disclosures within 60 days of service
- Must disclose individuals likely to have discoverable information
- Must provide copies of relevant documents
- Must provide damages calculations

**Proportionality Standard:**
- Discovery limited to what is reasonable for needs of case
- Consider: importance of issues, amount in controversy, parties' access to information, burden vs. benefit

**Sanctions:**
- Failure to make disclosures may result in striking pleadings, exclusion of evidence, or contempt

#### Discovery Methods

1. **Interrogatories** - Written questions (generally limited to 30)
2. **Requests for Production** - Documents and things
3. **Requests for Admission** - Facts to be admitted or denied
4. **Depositions** - Oral testimony under oath
5. **Subpoenas** - Third-party documents or testimony

### Trial Procedures

#### Pre-Trial

1. Case management conference
2. Discovery completion
3. Motions practice
4. Mediation (often court-ordered)
5. Pre-trial conference
6. Trial scheduling

#### Trial

1. Jury selection (if jury trial)
2. Opening statements
3. Plaintiff's case-in-chief
4. Defendant's case
5. Rebuttal
6. Closing arguments
7. Jury instructions and deliberation (if jury)
8. Verdict/judgment

#### Timeline Expectations

| Track | Expected Time to Trial |
|-------|----------------------|
| Streamlined cases | 12 months |
| General cases | 18 months |
| Complex cases | 24+ months |

### Appeals

#### Timing

- Notice of appeal: Within 30 days of final judgment
- Record preparation: 60-90 days
- Briefing schedule: 3-6 months
- Oral argument: If granted
- Decision: 2-12 months after argument

#### Standards of Review

| Issue | Standard |
|-------|----------|
| Factual findings | Clearly erroneous |
| Legal conclusions | De novo |
| Discretionary rulings | Abuse of discretion |

## 10. Attorney Fees and Costs

### Prevailing Party Provisions

Florida follows the "American Rule" - each party pays their own fees unless:
1. Contract provides for fee shifting
2. Statute authorizes fee recovery
3. Court awards fees as sanction

#### FAR/BAR Contract Provision

Standard FAR/BAR Section 17 states:
> "In any litigation permitted by this Contract, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party costs and fees, including reasonable attorney's fees."

**Remember Pesantes v. Kelley:** You must complete mediation to be entitled to fees under this provision.

#### Florida Reciprocity Statute

Florida Statute 57.105(7) provides reciprocity: If a contract allows one party to recover fees, the court may award fees to the other party if they prevail.

### Florida Statute 57.105 - Frivolous Litigation

Section 57.105 allows courts to award fees against parties (and their attorneys) who pursue frivolous claims or defenses.

#### When Fees Are Awarded

Fees must be awarded when the court finds that the losing party or attorney knew or should have known that:
- A claim or defense was not supported by material facts, OR
- The claim or defense would not be supported by existing law

#### Safe Harbor Provision

A 57.105 motion must be served 21 days before filing with the court. If the challenged claim/defense is withdrawn within 21 days, no fees are awarded.

#### Damages for Delay

Fees may also be awarded when actions are taken primarily for unreasonable delay.

### Fee Reasonableness Standards

Florida courts use the "lodestar" method to determine reasonable fees:

**Lodestar = Reasonable Hours x Reasonable Hourly Rate**

#### Factors Considered

1. Time and labor required
2. Novelty and difficulty of questions
3. Skill required
4. Customary fee in locality
5. Amount involved and results obtained
6. Experience and reputation of attorney
7. Whether fee is fixed or contingent

### Cost Recovery

Recoverable costs in Florida typically include:

| Cost Type | Typically Recoverable |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Filing fees | Yes |
| Service of process | Yes |
| Deposition costs | Yes |
| Expert witness fees | Sometimes (with limits) |
| Copy costs | Yes (reasonable) |
| Travel expenses | Sometimes |
| Mediation fees | Per contract |

### Practical Reality

> **Important Note:** Even with prevailing party provisions, full fee recovery is rarely achieved. Expect to recover 50-70% of actual fees incurred in most cases.

---

## 11. Small Claims Court

### Jurisdiction Limit

Florida small claims court jurisdiction is capped at **$8,000** (excluding costs and interest).

### Appropriate Real Estate Disputes

Small claims may be appropriate for:
- Security deposit disputes under $8,000

- Unpaid commissions (under limit)
- Minor property damage claims

### What Small Claims Cannot Do

- Defendant resides

### Procedures

#### Filing

1. Complete Statement of Claim form
2. Pay filing fee ($55-300 depending on amount)
3. Serve defendant
4. Attend pre-trial mediation (often required)
5. Trial before judge (no jury in small claims)

#### Timeline

- Trial typically set 30-60 days after filing
- Judgment entered same day as trial
- Appeals within 30 days

### Self-Representation

Small claims is designed for self-representation:
- Simplified procedures
- Judges expect non-lawyers

- Record judgment to create lien on real property
- Judgment liens valid for 10 years
